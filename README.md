## üìù Preface 
The timing for Artificial Intelligence (AI) could not be better. As an AI/data solution architect at 
Microsoft, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of AI, especially since the advent of 
OpenAI. The world is evolving rapidly, and traditional processes are being reimagined.

Take, for example, one of my insurance clients. They used to deal with vast amounts of unstructured 
data, such as PDFs and emails. Teams of hundreds of people manually extracted information from 
thousands of files, entered it into the custom structured format of Excel, validated the data, and 
passed it to business analysts to generate reports. Decision-makers would then rely on these reports 
to make critical choices.

Now, with AI, this entire workflow is automated. AI extracts data from structured, semi-structured, 
and unstructured sources, stores it in a database, and generates analytic reports. It even enables users 
to interact with their data conversationally. The result? Millions of dollars saved and a significant 
boost in productivity.

If you‚Äôre excited to be part of this transformative journey, you‚Äôve come to the right place. This book 
not only focuses on helping you pass the AI-102: Azure AI Engineer Associate Certification but also 
equips you with real-world project experience (Chapter 10). My goal is for you to walk away with both 
the confidence of a certified professional and practical skills that open doors to new opportunities.

Whether you‚Äôre considering a career switch to AI or enhancing your current skill set, I welcome you 
to this exciting moment. Let this book be your gateway to a rewarding and dynamic future. I hope 
you enjoy the journey! üöÄ

## üìö What this book covers 
This book is structured to closely follow the official Microsoft study guide for Exam AI-102, ensuring 
comprehensive coverage of the certification objectives. You may notice that some of the latest Azure 
AI services or features are either not included or only briefly mentioned. That‚Äôs intentional‚ÄîI focused 
on what‚Äôs required for the exam rather than trying to chase every new release. However, as long as you 
understand the foundational concepts‚Äîthe principles that power both current and future services‚Äî
 you‚Äôll be well-prepared to adapt to whatever comes next. Think of this book as a cornerstone for your 
AI career. That‚Äôs also why I included Chapter 10, which goes beyond the exam content to showcase 
real-world use cases and project examples. These are designed to not only reinforce your knowledge 
but also help you transition from passing the exam to confidently applying AI in practical scenarios. 

This book will help you earn your certification‚Äîbut more importantly, it will prepare you to think 
and operate like a real AI professional from day one.
Let‚Äôs look at what is covered in each chapter.
